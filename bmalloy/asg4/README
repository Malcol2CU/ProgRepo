The easiest part of this project: getting the sprites and background

Problems that I had in completing this project: fixing the jitteryness of my sprite animations

Backgroung images came from Mobile game graphics. 

Final Project:
I look to expand on this project by adding a health bar, more attacks, making the ghost attack grim, and by adding more enemys and perhaps a final boss at the end.
